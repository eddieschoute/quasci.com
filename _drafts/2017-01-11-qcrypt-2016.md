Recently, I was fortunate enough to attend the [QCrypt 2016](http://2016.qcrypt.net/) conference being held in Washington DC.
It is my first time attending this conference and I will highlight some of the presentation that
were of particular interest to me.
It was also a great opportunity to meet with friends and colleagues after moving overseas
from Europe to the United States.

## Quantum Key Distribution
A major topic a QCrypt this year was, of course, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).
This topic of research stems from the famous [BB84 protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84), published in a 1984 paper by Bennett and Brassard[^1].
It proposes a protocol that uses quantum communication to distribute a secret key between two parties.
There are many classical (i.e. non-quantum) protocols such as [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
which would make this unnecessary,
were it not for the fact that the BB84 protocol is provably secure.
This means even an adversary with _unlimited_ (quantum) resources cannot figure out what the key is;
the same cannot be said about RSA!
(Even worse, a finite quantum computer can break RSA.)
Unfortunately for theorists, the following little quote still holds

> In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.

As evidenced by the many (poster) presentations implementing QKD is far from a done deal.
E.g., see presentations on [free-space QKD](http://2016.qcrypt.net/invited-talks#jennewein),
[battling with quantum hackers](http://2016.qcrypt.net/invited-talks/#lo),
or [field trials of high-speed QKD](http://2016.qcrypt.net/contributed-talks/#dixon);
as well industry exhibits and a lot of [posters](http://2016.qcrypt.net/posters/).

## Device Independent Cryptography
Another topic that may also come as surprising --it certainly was for me-- is
[device independent quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device-independent_quantum_cryptography).
It is quite natural to assume that you have complete control of your device
and an adversary could attack your communications;
it is less so to remove this assumption.
Let's say you want to generate a secure random number,
you may, for example, refer to `/dev/urandom` on Linux for a pseudo-random byte:

{% highlight shell %}
$ od -vAn -N1 -tu1 < /dev/urandom 
59
$ od -vAn -N1 -tu1 < /dev/urandom 
148
{% endhighlight %}

But how would you _guarantee_ that a bit is actually secret,
i.e. no one else knows any information about this bit.
With randomness generation ([tutorial](http://2016.qcrypt.net/tutorials-2/#colbeck))
it is possible to certify that two black boxes capable of QKD have indeed generated random bits.
